# MuseBSL


An attempt at reimplement a Python binding for Muse EEG. Goals:

- [ ] Use [BSL](https://github.com/fcbg-hnp-meeg/bsl) instead of lsl as it is more efficient.
- [ ] Reimplement [muse-lsl](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/) that isn't maintained anymore (?) in a more streamlined and updated way.


Problem: it's getting a bit too complex and I don't understand muse-lsl well enough to progress. **Help is needed**.
